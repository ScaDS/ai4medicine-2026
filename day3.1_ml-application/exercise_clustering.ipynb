    "# Comprehensive Exercise on Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "One extremely helpful application of clustering is in data exploration. Clustering helps us find fundamental structures in data that is unknown to us, e.g., whether individual samples have any similarities that we do not yet recognize.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try this out on a dataset about demographics, health metrics, and engagement patterns of patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the [Patient Segmentation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nudratabbas/patient-segmentation-data) from Kaggle (CC0: Public Domain).\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains 2000 patient records with comprehensive information including:\n",
    "* Demographics like age, gender, geographic location\n",
    "* Health metrics like height, weight, chronic conditions\n",
    "* Healthcare utilization like annual visit frequency\n",
    "* Insurance & engagement like insurance type, preventive care participation flag\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to apply clustering on the patient data for a so-called Segmentation Analysis for identifying distinct patient personas (e.g., \"High-risk seniors\", \"Young healthy adults\", \"Chronic disease patients\").\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your tasks:**\n",
    "* Load the data from the file [patient_segmentation_dataset.csv](patient_segmentation_dataset.csv)\n",
    "* Inspect the data and make yourself familiar with its content, data types, distributions, etc.\n",
    "* Decide for a fitting clustering algorithm based on your data insights (e.g., can KMeans be used for this specific data?)\n",
    "* Prepare the data for clustering and apply the clustering algorithm\n",
    "* Explore the clusters (patient segments) to hopefully gain helpful insights\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use of the AI assistant**\n",
    "\n",
    "It's best to approach this analysis in a structured way:\n",
    "* Provide the assistant with an overview and your overall analysis goal\n",
    "* Ask for an analysis plan with separate steps\n",
    "* Then, use the assistant to tackle each step, always provide sufficient context"
